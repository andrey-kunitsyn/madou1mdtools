This package contains the source materials (code/art/script) for the English
translation project for the Mega Drive game Madou Monogatari I.

                    *          Build Instructions          *
                    ****************************************
                    
The build system is only set up for Unix-like systems, though none of the code
is fundamentally dependent on this and could be ported with a bit of effort.
You'll need GCC and libpng.

You'll first need a ROM image of Madou Monogatari I for the Mega Drive. It
should match the following specifications:

  No-Intro filename: Madou Monogatari I (Japan).md
  CRC32:             DD82C401
  MD5:               41B8BA3569E3F4F98155DEA64318D223
  SHA-1:             143456600E44F543796CF6ADE77830115A8F2F99

Rename it "madou1md.md" and place it in the "madou1md" folder. Then:

$ cd madou1md
$ ./build.sh

build.sh should then build all the necessary tools and output the translated
ROM as madou1md_en.md.

If you want to modify the project, check build.sh to see where the resources
that get inserted into the game are coming from.

See COPYING. Basically, everything by me (Supper) is GPLv3, and everything else
is under the terms of whoever wrote it.
